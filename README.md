## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to utilize a json source of data from the network and create an app based on this data, which is in a production ready state, capable of finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## What is exhibited in this project?
In this project there is:
* Usage of MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handling error cases in Android.
* Addition of a widget.
* Leverage of a third-party library.
* Usage of fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

## App Description
The task was to create a Android Baking App that allows Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. The user selects a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all. One of the skills demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in the data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
